# Spedi

A speculative disassembler for the variable-size Thumb ISA. Given an
 ELF file as input, Spedi can:

  - Recover correct assembly instructions.
  - Recover targets of switch jumps tables.
  - Identify functions in the binary and their call graph.

Spedi works directly on the binary without using any symbol information. We found Spedi
 to outperform IDA Pro in our experiments.

# Idea

Spedi recovers all possible Basic Blocks (BBs) available in the binary. BBs that
 share the same jump instruction are grouped in a Maximal Block (MB). Then, MBs
 are refined  using overlap and CFG conflict analysis.
 Details can be found in our CASES'16 paper "*Speculative disassembly of binary code*".
 The paper is available [here].

Spedi (almost) perfectly recovers assembly instructions from our benchmarks binaries
with 99.96% average. In comparison, IDA Pro has an average of 95.83% skewed by the
relative poor performance on *sha* benchmark.

Spedi precisely recovers 97.46% of functions on average. That is, it identifies the correct start address and end address. Compare that to 40.53% average achieved by IDA Pro.

A nice property of our technique is that it's also fast and scales well with increased
benchmark size. For example, spedi disassembles *du* (50K instructions) in about 150 ms.
Note that there is good room for further optimizations.

# Usage
Build the project and try it on one of the binaries in our benchmark suite
 available in this [repository].
 
 Run the following commands to build the project: 
```sh
$ cmake .
$ make
```

The following command will instruct `spedi`to speculatively disassemble
 the `.text` section,

```sh
$ ./spedi -t -s -f $FILE > speculative.inst
```

Use the following command to disassemble the `.text` section
 based on ARM code mapping symbols which provides the ground truth about correct instructions,

```sh
$ ./spedi -t -f $FILE > correct.inst
```
The easiest way to compare both outputs is by using,

```sh
$ diff -y correct.inst speculative.inst |less
```

Currently, you need to manually modify `main.cpp` to show results related to
 switch table and call-graph recovery.

# Road map

Spedi is an academic proof-of-concept tool. Currently, it's not on our priority list.
 However, there are certain features that we have in mind for the future, namely:

  - **Mixed-mode ARM/Thumb disassembly**. The general idea of speculative disassembly    provides the framework to do that.
    Basically, one needs to speculatively disassemble a code region
    twice. One time in Thumb mode, and a second time in ARM mode. Later, mode switching instructions (mainly `bx` and `blx`) should be analyzed. This [paper] provides some related details.
  - **Support for x86/x64**. Thumb and similar RISC-like ISA have limited variability. Basically, instructions can either be 2 or 4 bytes width.
  We need to push the challenge even further by supporting x86/x64. To this end, overlap
  analysis might span more than two MB which complicates things. Current Maximal Block data structure is not efficient to do that.
  - **Refactorings**. The code is tightly coupled with our ELF reader. Also, it is specific to Thumb ISA. We need to make it more modular to support other ISAs and binary formats.
  - **ELF Reader**: Our ELF reader is based on [libelfin]. We inherit some memory leakage issues. Additionally, the reader might crash on binaries with dwarf debug info. These issues needs to be addressed either in upstream or directly here.

# Related work

Recently, Andriesse et. al. have been working on `Nucleus`, a tool for function identification in x64 binaries. Their paper "*Compiler-Agnostic Function Detection in Binaries*" was accepted at IEEE Euro S&P 2017. They use more or less the same function identification techniques implemented in Spedi. If you are interested in x64 support,
you can have a look at their [tool].

Note, however, that their tool is based
on the assumption that recent x64 compilers allocate jump-table data in `.rodata` section.
That makes instruction recovery significantly easier since it can be done reliably with
linear sweep. In comparison, Spedi handles the more general case of mixed code/data
using speculative disassembly.
